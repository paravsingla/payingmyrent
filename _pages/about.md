On Feb 8th, 2020, which was my 24th Birthday, I realized how bad my life was. I set out on a one year journey to improve my life. My goal is to pick one area of my life every month and create a system to improve and sustain the quality of that particular aspect.

I started this blog on Apr 5th, 2020, but the posts have the dates on which I wrote them in my journal. I'll keep only the relevant portions of my journal entries here.

I write this blog mostly so I can see my progress but if you're reading this, I hope I inspire you to take action.
