Food.

All I can think about is food.

I wake up and I'm hungry. I go to sleep and I'm hungry. I think I haven't thought this much about food ever. It doesn't help that I can smell something good cooking from a mile away. I'm really, really tempted. 

But this is something I have to get over with. I have created a strict nutrition plan. It contains a lot of whey protein, which I know, is not the wisest thing since protein from real food sources is always better than the processed stuff, but since I don't eat eggs or meat, its the only thing I have.

I have tracked the calories for the past few days. I've got to say, it feels good. Along with my daily weight journal, the calorie tracking thing makes me feel legit. 

Like I've turned pro. 

Its like when you buy your first professional grade gear. It smells different. It feels different. It marks a point in your life to which you can point and say that that's the moment I turned pro.

I think this moment is it for me. I'm using MyFitnessPal. Though I like writing things on a paper better than writing them on screens, there are some features the app has that are just make it a more appropriate choice than maintaining a diary.

I'm seeing progress in my lifts, I'm seeing progress in my appearance, and I don't know, I might just work up the courage to talk to the man in the mirror and let him know that this is real. That we're doing this. 

And that its gonna change our lives.
