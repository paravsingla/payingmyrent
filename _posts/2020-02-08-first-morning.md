I feel good after receiving a couple of phone calls. Last night is kind of a fainted memory. But I do remember that I made a plan. And today is the first day of me following that plan. I look at what I wrote down:

1. Feb 8 - Mar 8 = Physical
2. Mar 8 - Apr 8 = Nutrition
3. Apr 8 - May 8 = Hygiene
4. May 8 - Jun 8 = Finance
5. Jun 8 - Jul 8 = Career
6. Jul 8 - Aug 8 = Break/Observe
7. Aug 8 - Sep 8 = Hobbies
8. Sep 8 - Oct 8 = Side Hustle
9. Oct 8 - Nov 8 = Style
10. Nov 8 - Dec 8 = Social Skills
11. Dec 8 - Jan 8  = Game
12. Jan 8 - Feb 8 = Spirituality

**Note:** Goal is to implement a system every month to improve one aspect of life and then follow that system for rest of my life.

Today is the start of Physical. I strap my helmet on, start my bike and go to the most popular gym I knew in the town. Gold's Gym. They take my measurements. I'm 5'10, I weigh 112 Kg, and my body fat percentage is around 38. That's all I hear. After the guy stops talking, I declare that I want to be under 15% BF while preserving whatever muscle mass I have. He all but laughs at me. Probably gets a lot of fat guys who do the same. I'll show this prick, I say to myself.

On my way home, I buy a bio-impedance scale. I write dates on a piece of paper, from Feb 8 to 6 July. I write a big 95 on 6th July. I want to pick 8th, but the paper runs out of space, so 6 will have to do. I'll write my weight every morning on this.

This month, my goal is to educate myself on lifting. I mean really educate. I start watching videos on proper exercise forms from multiple people on youtube. I know I have to keep it simple. I have gone to the gym on and off in the past, so I use my favorite split - the Bro split. I know its not optimal, but I'm not going for optimal. I'm going for sustainable this time.

I trim my facial hair and apologize to the man in the mirror. He looks hopeful, well, at least to me. I can never tell what he's thinking.
