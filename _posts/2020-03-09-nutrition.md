Today is the start of the second month - Nutrition. I have some time to think about what I want from this 'challenge' - as I call it to myself. I have always seen food as entertainment. I guess it comes with being born in a Punjabi family. Food is a crucial part of our life. 

Feeling sad? 

Here's some comfort food. 

Feeling happy?

Here's a celebratory treat.

Feeling bored?

Let's make some fast food.

Great weather?

Time for some fried stuff.

Lousy weather?

Stay inside and eat this food.

My name, Parav, means festival, or a celebratory occasion. When it comes to food, it feels like that is all I did all my life. 

But I got fat when there was no good food around. You know, I have been such a food enthusiast, that I had gotten used to the good, home cooked food. I used to cook myself - a little bit. In the hostel, there is no means to cook your own food. The mess food is abysmal. I should, like most people, have lost a ton of weight. 

Nah. 

Not with all the processed crap that was available. 

So, today, I start learning to treat food as food. A source of energy. Well, there's nothing wrong with enjoying it, but I've gotta tame my impulses. And count the calories. 

Yes, counting calories is imperative. 

For the time being, I'm thinking I'll go into a deficit of about 500 calories. In about an year, I should be able to reach where I want to - weight wise.

I've got to get rid of all the cookies that I've bought first. I'll donate them to friends. 

There is nothing really that I have to learn about food. So, I'll learn how to cook and make my own meals. It is important to know how to feed yourself. And with the coronavirus now coming to India, I think the situation is about to get sticky very soon. I better stock up on the essentials.

In other news, my weight has decreased a little. That's good.

**Weigh in:** 113.9
