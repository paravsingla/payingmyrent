The second month comes to an end today. This month was about nutrition. I have to say - even though I thought I knew almost everything about calories and macros and all that crap, I've learnt a lot. I've learnt a lot about myself. What I'm capable of. Also, how everyone says that you are probably eating more than you think you are, that was true in my case.

Tracking my calories even for seven days gave me a really really good idea about everything. Since I moved on from the sandwiches and started cooking real food - I've started tracking my calories. It is actually not that hard. I think I'm just lazy.

I was reading Brian Tracy's book on self discipline. It got me thinking about the whole idea of this blog - paying your rent. It's not something I've discussed at length, mainly because I'm still trying to understand it better. But what Brian says about the difference between people who are successful and the people who are not really helped the idea sink in.

See, its simple. If you wanna be ripped, you have to find out what the habits of people who are ripped are. Those are your 'rents'. Those are the things that you're gonna have to do all your life to stay ripped. If it wasn't for youtube, this task would have been difficult, but man, technology has changed things. 

A cursory look at the channels of even a couple of fitness youtubers tells me that they all are calorie conscious, and probably track every calorie. They are very considerate in what they put in their body. Their workouts are very deliberate, for the most part, and its not easy, despite how they make it seem. It definitely is an obsession for these people. They obsess about every little detail. They track everything. There's a guy who has spreadsheets upon spreadsheets of his weigh-ins, his calories and his lifts - for years. 

I'm slowly realizing that if I have to reach that level, I'm gonna have to become that guy. I'm gonna have to become obsessed with it. I said earlier that I don't have time to obsess about every millimeter of my bicep size, even though its an exaggeration, its not really that far from reality of these people. I'll have to become one of them.

It's just something I have to do. It is a choice, really. I've decided that I'm willing to pay the rent.
