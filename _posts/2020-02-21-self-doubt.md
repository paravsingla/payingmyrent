I'm halfway through 'Atomic Habits'. Its a nice book. He talks about the effort being collected somewhere and then showing up suddenly. I believe him because I want to. I step on the scale every morning and every morning, I see 115.1. There's nothing wrong with the scale.

I have a guitar and a piano. I don't use them very often. They just sit there, collecting dust, looking at me disapprovingly. I think about all the things I started and didn't finish and it scares me. What if they all come alive one day? Angry at me? That's my worst nightmare.

I'll finish this, I say to myself and I let it go. 

My bodybuilding education is almost complete. I have watched AthleanX, and some other video makers. I have gone through various programs that are available on Bodybuilding.com. I have read a couple of highly recommended books. I have gone through the top posts of fitness and bodybuilding related subreddits. There is a lot of conflicting information out there, but once you take in enough of it, it starts to make sense. 

I have tweaked my bro split to make it more efficient without destroying its enjoyability. Even though Nutrition starts next month, I have started eating clean.

But there's this nagging voice in the back of my head. I can't seem to get rid of it. This voice takes every chance for telling me that the changes I've made are temporary. That this is not who I am. I am a lazy slob. That I should quit pretending and accept it already.

I don't know how long I can keep fighting this.

**Weigh in:** 115.1
