February comes to an end. This Coronavirus thing is serious. People are dying. Hope it doesn't become what people are predicting it will become.

But I have to keep going. I have mostly settled into the routine. I don't even think about going to the gym now. Its just something I have to get done. I think this is how people who do it over the long term do it. They just treat it as a menial task. They don't obsess over it. Because the more I obsess, the more I get frustrated, and the more are the chances of me convincing myself that something else has more priority over this.

That's not true. Someone on reddit said that 75% of your problems can be solved in the gym. I think that's largely true. 

I already see a change in myself. Even though the numbers on the scale haven't changed, I feel different. I feel better. I have to keep doing this. Wake up every morning, and get my ass to the gym. One of the gyms that I used to go to had a really good quote written on the wall. 

"The only bad workout is one you didn't do."

Sometimes, when I'm not feeling it, I leave after twenty minutes. But I make sure to go to the gym. This is what I'm aiming for - to build a habit so strong, my legs automatically start moving when I wake up in the morning. 

If I have to get a physique worth showing off - because let's face it, being attractive in the world we live in is a huge advantage - I have to pay my rent. And the rent is going to the gym and lifting heavy weights.
