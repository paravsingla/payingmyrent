I check my phone. Its 11:58 PM. I feel my heart rate go up. I know nothing is coming, yet, there is a strange anticipation. I hope for something. No, I long for something. But I know its not coming. A sadness washes over me. I turn on the lights and pick up my guitar. I pluck each string one by one to check if its in tune. I'm not very good at it, but I can hear when its out of tune. 

I play a few bars of my favorite sad songs. I check my phone again. 

12:05

I sing myself Happy Birthday. 

I break down into tears.

Now I'm lonely.

I've turned twenty four. I have two friends who I know will wish me along with my family in the morning. I thank God for that. I convince myself that celebrating at midnight happens in the movies and on social media. Real people are like me, alone and lonely. 

I can't go to sleep and still feel sad, so I pick up my song notebook. Well, I say its a notebook but its just a few sheets of paper bound by a bulldog clip. I try to write something. Nothing good comes out. 

I break down. Again.

I take off my shirt and look at myself in the mirror. To take stock of the situation. To think about what I did that got me here.

Now, I'm fat, ugly and lonely. I say some real mean things to the person looking at me from the mirror. Things I know I'll apologize for in the morning. Our relationship is like that. I'm the abuser and he keeps coming back for some reason.

I tell him that I'll make a change. I'll start going to the gym and start a diet. He doesn't sound convinced. He's seen this time and time again. But he nods his head. Says a few words of appreciation.

I'm frustrated. I'm angry. I haven't been angry in a long time. I know something has to change. But it has to last. 

I ask him to sit down and discuss a plan with me. We have a lot to fix, I say. I know he doesn't trust me. I have made countless plans, never saw one through. He doesn't trust me, and he has no reason to.

Nevertheless, we make a plan. This plan is a little different from the usual plans I made. This plan lasts a lot longer - a whole 12 months. This plan is simple - fix one thing every month. This plan I will see through.
