I wake up to my phone buzzing. Its a message from Amazon, saying my sandwich maker will be delivered today. 

Finally.

I had been waiting this for a long time - well, it seems like a long time to me. I should let you know that I've strugged with various forms of Impulse Control Disorder all my life. Before making a purchase, I have to wait to make sure that its not an impulse purchase. 

Does waiting help?

Sometimes. But its the best I can do.

Its been a while since I wrote an update. Well, thats because there was nothing much to report. I have now fixed my diet, at least for the forseeable future. I read in Tim Ferris' book that people who lost substantial amount of weight ate the same meals again and again. This is what I'm trying to do.

I've bought a shit ton of sauces to apply on my sandwiches. The basic construction of it will remain the same. I'll use the sauces to change the flavor. This is a 400 cal meal. I'm thinking about having two of them per day, atleast until I get bored.

The sandwich maker I've ordered is just to grill the sandwiches. I don't like them cold.

I've stopped loggin calories into MFP. You'd think after I shit talked about turning pro and all, that I would at least stick with it for more than a couple weeks. The thing is, I'm eating the same meals every day, which I did not expect. So, everyday, the calorie count is 1700. There's no point in loggin them if I know the number already. 

When I start varying my meals, I'll start logging them again. I've also started meditating - which has nothing to do with nutrition, but it helps with the hunger. I'm not so hungry anymore. I mean, sure, if I smell something really good, I'm tempted - but who isn't. The important thing is that I don't give in to those temptations.

The coronavirus thing is getting really serious. Today was curfew. I think we might be on the brink of a crisis. I've bought a shit ton of milk and oats, just in case.
