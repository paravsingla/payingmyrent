Today is Valentine's Day. Not that it matters to me. I didn't skip gym, and I feel pretty good about my lifts. They haven't really decreased since the last time. 

I watch some more videos on form and bodybuilding. At this point, I've basically watched everything relevant. I scour through the various fitness subreddits. This past week, I read about a few programs, even though I don't want to change mine, it'll be good to incorporate some elements from them.

Started with Stronglifts 5x5, then read about 5/3/1. 

Read a couple of books.

The subreddits are actually helpful, though the signal to noise ratio is quite low. 

My weight has still not gone down from 115. I hear it is normal for the weight to increase while starting strength training. It is a little disappointing though. 

It doesn't really feel like its really happening. Like, I'm really doing this. So far, there's nothing much to do except go to the gym. The only thing I'm afraid of is my excitement wearing off and me convincing myself that something else is more important than this. Then, I would really not be able to show my face to the man in the mirror.

He's been mostly quiet. I think he's keeping his expectations low. He has his doubts but refrains from voicing them. Besides, I already have a reason to sing a few sad songs today.

**Weigh in:** 115.1 Kg
